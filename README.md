A shitpost mod born out of necessity - [https://x.com/Shayy_TV/status/1896358807233761588](https://x.com/Shayy_TV/status/1896358807233761588)

The most annoying mod on planet earth lets you feel like Steve from the hit movie Minecraft in the game Minecraft based on the movie Minecraft.

### Features
It will play voice lines from the movie upon different interactions such as:
- Opening the game
- Respawning
- Picking up/using/crafting items
- Using blocks
- Switching dimensions
- Even looking at some mobs

More sounds will be added in the future. Depends on what Jack Black says in the movie.

### Dependencies
This mod requires these other mods to work:
- Fabric Api
- Fabric Language Kotlin
